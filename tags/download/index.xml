This is my tentative work flow for downloading movie streams online. The gist of what I've learned about this process is that every HTTP Live Stream (HLS) begins with an .m3u8 playlist with a MIME type of x-mpegURL or vnd.apple.mpegURL. This playlist lists a series of .ts files that are streamed one at a time and decoded so your browser is not burdened with downloading the entire movie every time you refresh the page.</description></item><item><title>Download YouTube Videos</title><link>https://trimad.github.io/post/2022-04-16-downloading-youtube-videos/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trimad.github.io/post/2022-04-16-downloading-youtube-videos/</guid><description>

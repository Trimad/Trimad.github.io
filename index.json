The new file name is a zero-padded four digit number, followed by \u0026quot;.png\u0026quot;. The script is changing the name of all png files in the current working directory to a 4 digit zero padded number followed by .png, this is useful if you have a sequence of files in a folder and you want to sort them in order and not have any gaps in the numbering.

The script imports the os, PIL and math modules, it sets the folder path where the images are located and get the list of all files in that folder. It opens the first image and gets its RGB values, then creates an empty list to store the distances. It iterates over the remaining images in the folder, if the file is a png it opens the image and gets its RGB values. Then it calculates the distance between the RGB values of the current image and the first image using the Euclidean distance formula, appends the distance and the image name to the distance list. The script then sorts the distance list by the distance, renames the first image to \u0026quot;0000.png\u0026quot; and renames each image to the next number in the sequence using the os.rename() function, and 4 digits zero-padded number followed by the extension.\nFrame Interpolation FILM Activate the Conda environment\n1conda activate frame_interpolation From the Conda Shell, cd to the FILM directory\n1cd C:\\Users\\trima\\FILM Place the images you would like to interpolate in the \u0026quot;photos\u0026quot; directory and run this command to begin interpolating them.\n1python -m eval.interpolator_cli --pattern \u0026#34;photos\u0026#34; --model_path pretrained_models\\film_net\\Style\\saved_model --times_to_interpolate 1 --output_video Color Grading By Mean 1import os 2import cv2 3import numpy as np 4 5def average_color_grading(folder_path): 6 # Get all image filenames in the folder 7 filenames = [f for f in os.listdir(folder_path) if f.endswith(\u0026#39;.jpg\u0026#39;) or f.endswith(\u0026#39;.png\u0026#39;)] 8 9 # Initialize a sum of color grading for all images 10 color_grading_sum = None 11 12 # Iterate through all images, adding each image\u0026#39;s color grading to the sum 13 for filename in filenames: 14 print(\u0026#34;averaging \u0026#34; + filename) 15 image_path = os.path.join(folder_path, filename) 16 image = cv2.imread(image_path) 17 18 # Average color grading of an image is computed as mean of its pixels 19 color_grading = np.mean(image, axis=(0, 1)) 20 21 # Add the color grading of the current image to the sum 22 if color_grading_sum is None: 23 color_grading_sum = color_grading 24 else: 25 color_grading_sum += color_grading 26 27 # Divide the sum of color grading by the number of images to get the average color grading 28 average_color_grading = color_grading_sum / len(filenames) 29 30 return average_color_grading 31 32def apply_color_grading(folder_path, average_color_grading): 33 # Get all image filenames in the folder 34 filenames = [f for f in os.listdir(folder_path) if f.endswith(\u0026#39;.jpg\u0026#39;) or f.endswith(\u0026#39;.png\u0026#39;)] 35 36 # Create a new folder to save the color graded frames 37 color_graded_folder = os.path.join(folder_path, \u0026#39;color_graded\u0026#39;) 38 os.makedirs(color_graded_folder, exist_ok=True) 39 40 # Iterate through all images, applying the average color grading to each frame 41 for i, filename in enumerate(filenames): 42 print(\u0026#34;color grading \u0026#34; + filename) 43 image_path = os.path.join(folder_path, filename) 44 image = cv2.imread(image_path) 45 46 # Subtract the average color grading from each pixel to apply the color grading 47 color_graded_image = image - np.mean(image, axis=(0, 1)) + average_color_grading 48 49 # Zero-pad the sequential number and save the color graded image with the zero-padded sequential number 50 color_graded_image_path = os.path.join(color_graded_folder, str(i).zfill(len(str(len(filenames)))) + \u0026#39;.jpg\u0026#39;) 51 cv2.imwrite(color_graded_image_path, color_graded_image) 52 53folder_path = \u0026#39;images\u0026#39; 54average_color_grading = average_color_grading(folder_path) 55apply_color_grading(folder_path, average_color_grading) This program applies color grading to a set of images stored in the \u0026quot;images\u0026quot; folder.

The gist of what I've learned about this process is that every HTTP Live Stream (HLS) begins with an .m3u8 playlist with a MIME type of x-mpegURL or vnd.apple.mpegURL. This playlist lists a series of .ts files that are streamed one at a time and decoded so your browser is not burdened with downloading the entire movie every time you refresh the page. These .ts files can also be aggregated and assembled into a video.\nFinding the Playlist `.m3u8` playlists load at the very beginning of the stream and are easy to spot in Firefox Developer Edition. Navigate to the stream, press F12, click on the \"Network\" tab and refresh the page. In this first example we see the .m3u8 playlist referred to as a Manifest. It sticks out in Firefox Developer Edition because the MIME type is vnd.apple.mpegURL.

Read more about usePageBundles.\nWith page bundles, resources for a page or section, like images or attached files, live in the same directory as the content itself rather than in your static directory.\nHugo Clarity supports the use of leaf bundles, which are any directories within the content directory that contain an index.md file. Hugo's documentation gives this example:\n1content 2├── about 3│ ├── index.md 4├── posts 5│ ├── my-post 6│ │ ├── content1.md 7│ │ ├── content2.md 8│ │ ├── image1.jpg 9│ │ ├── image2.png 10│ │ └── index.md 11│ └── my-other-post 12│ └── index.md 13│ 14└── another-section 15 ├── .. 16 └── not-a-leaf-bundle 17 ├── .. 18 └── another-leaf-bundle 19 └── index.md In the above example `content` directory, there are four leaf bundles: about: This leaf bundle is at the root level (directly under content directory) and has only the index.md.\nmy-post: This leaf bundle has the index.md, two other content Markdown files and two image files. image1 is a page resource of my-post and only available in my-post/index.md resources. image2 is a page resource of my-post and only available in my-post/index.md resources.\nmy-other-post: This leaf bundle has only the index.md.\nanother-leaf-bundle: This leaf bundle is nested under couple of directories. This bundle also has only the index.md.\nThe hierarchy depth at which a leaf bundle is created does not matter, as long as it is not inside another leaf bundle.\nAdvantages to using page bundles The image below is part of the bundle of this page, and is located at content/post/bundle/building.png. Because it's within this page's bundle, the markup for the image only has to specify the image's filename, building.png.\nIf you ever change the name of the directory in which this Markdown file and the image reside, the reference to the image would not need to be updated.\nIn addition to more cleanly organizing your content and related assets, when using page bundles, Hugo Clarity will automatically generate markup for modern image formats, which are smaller in file size.\nFor instance, when you reference an image like building.png, Hugo Clarity will check to see if the same image (based on filename) exists in WebP, AVIF or JXL formats. If you inspect the image above, you'll see a \u0026lt;source\u0026gt; element for building.webp, because that file is also present. Hugo Clarity will only include the markup if these images exist.\nBrowsers that support these formats and the \u0026lt;picture\u0026gt; element will load them, while browsers that do not will fall-back to the default image. Read more about this process.\nFinally, note that page assets can be further managed and refined within the page's front matter if you wish, and are not limited to images alone.\nDisadvantages to using page bundles Page resources in a bundle are only available to the page with which they are bundled — that means you can't include an image with one page and then reference it from another.\nImages that are being used in multiple places are more appropriate for your Hugo assets directory. Unlike files in the Hugo static directory, files in the assets directory can be run through Hugo Pipes, which includes image processing.\n","link":"https://trimad.github.io/archives/bundle/","section":"archives","tags":["Hugo"],"title":"Using Hugo page bundles"},{"body":" ","link":"https://trimad.github.io/archives/map/","section":"archives","tags":null,"title":"Using OpenStreetMap"},{"body":"ffmpeg is a complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video.\nffmpeg Download ffmpeg Documentation Audio Processing Convert to 8kHz, single-channel PCM 1ffmpeg -i \u0026#34;input.mp3\u0026#34; -ar 8000 -ac 1 output.wav Convert to 16kHz, single-channel PCM 1ffmpeg -i \u0026#34;input.mp3\u0026#34; -ar 16000 -ac 1 output.wav Convert to 48kHz, single-channel PCM 1ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -ar 48000 -ac 1 output.wav Video Processing Add Music to a Video 1ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -i music.mp3 -codec copy -shortest output.mp4 -i video.mp4 Select “video.mp4” as an input file from the same directory. -i music.mp3 Select “music.mp4” as an input file from the same directory. -codec copy Specifies that we are not re-encoding anything. -shortest Use this flag if the video length is shorter than the audio length. Otherwise, use no flag at all here. Assemble images into a video 1ffmpeg -framerate 60 -s 2560x1440 -i %04d.png output.mp4 -framerate 60 Set the frame rate to 60FPS. -s 2560x1440 Set the video resolution to 2560x1440 pixels. -i %04d.png This flag assumes there is a folder of .png files in the same directory named in the format 0001.png, 0002.png, etc. It will load all images following this naming convention as inputs to be processed.

A slower preset will provide better compression (compression is quality per filesize). This means that, for example, if you target a certain file size or constant bit rate, you will achieve better quality with a slower preset. Similarly, for constant quality encoding, you will simply save bitrate by choosing a slower preset. Use the slowest preset that you have patience for. The available presets in descending order of speed are: ultrafast superfast veryfast faster fast medium (default preset) slow slower veryslow -crf 18 Constant Rate Factor (CRF). The range of the CRF scale is 0–51, where 0 is lossless, 23 is the default, and 51 is worst quality possible. A lower value generally leads to higher quality, and a subjectively sane range is 17–28. Consider 17 or 18 to be visually lossless or nearly so; it should look the same or nearly the same as the input but it isn't technically lossless. -c:a copy Copy the audio codec from that of the input file to the output file -pix_fmt yuv420p This flag is only needed for your output to work in QuickTime, Windows Media player and other offline media players. These players only support the YUV planar color space with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling for H.264 video. Otherwise, depending on your source, ffmpeg may output to a pixel format that may be incompatible with these players. Video Filters Stack two videos side-by-side 1ffmpeg -i \u0026#34;left.mp4\u0026#34; -i \u0026#34;right.mp4\u0026#34; -filter_complex hstack output.mp4 This command uses the ffmpeg software to combine two video files, \u0026quot;left.mp4\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;right.mp4\u0026quot;, into a single output video file \u0026quot;output.mp4\u0026quot;. The \u0026quot;-i\u0026quot; option specifies the input video files. The \u0026quot;-filter_complex\u0026quot; option applies the \u0026quot;hstack\u0026quot; filter, which horizontally stacks the two input videos side by side to form a single output video.\nVertical scroll and wrap 1ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf scroll=vertical=0.001,format=yuv420p output.mp4 This ffmpeg command takes an input video file named \u0026quot;input.mp4\u0026quot; and applies a video filter to it that creates a scrolling effect with a vertical scroll speed of 0.001 units per frame. The output video is then saved as \u0026quot;output.mp4\u0026quot; in the YUV420P format.\nRemove black bars from top and bottom of video 1ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \u0026#34;crop=iw:ih-40:0:20\u0026#34; -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4 Resize a video's height while maintaining aspect width aspect ratio 1ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \u0026#34;scale=-1:1280\u0026#34; -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4 Crop a video down the center 1ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \u0026#34;crop=720:ih:((iw-720)/2):0\u0026#34; -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4 Do the above three in one go 1ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \u0026#34;crop=iw:ih-40:0:20,scale=-1:1280,crop=720:ih:((iw-720)/2):0\u0026#34; -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4 Animated GIF Create an animated GIF from a video 1ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.gif Assembled a folder of images into an animated GIF Generate a palette ```Shell ffmpeg -y -i %3d.png -vf palettegen palette.png ``` The command line above is using FFmpeg to process a sequence of PNG images, where each image is named with a number and a 3 digit format, such as \u0026quot;001.png\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;002.png\u0026quot;, etc. In summary, this command is generating a color palette from a sequence of PNG images and saving the palette to the file \u0026quot;palette.png\u0026quot;. This palette can be used to create a GIF animation from the sequence of images. The resulting palette will have a smaller number of colors than the original images, allowing for a smaller file size for the final GIF.\nThe options used in the command are:\n\u0026quot;-y\u0026quot; : Overwrite output files without asking. \u0026quot;-i %3d.png\u0026quot; : The input file is a sequence of PNG images, where the file name format is \u0026quot;%3d\u0026quot; (3 digits) followed by \u0026quot;.png\u0026quot; \u0026quot;-vf palettegen\u0026quot; : This is a video filter that generates a color palette from the input image sequence. \u0026quot;palette.png\u0026quot; : This is the output file name for the generated color palette.

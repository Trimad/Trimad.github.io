This is my tentative work flow for downloading movie streams online. The gist of what I've learned about this process is that every HTTP Live Stream (HLS) begins with an .m3u8 playlist with a MIME type of x-mpegURL or vnd.apple.mpegURL. This playlist lists a series of .ts files that are streamed one at a time and decoded so your browser is not burdened with downloading the entire movie every time you refresh the page.</description></item><item><title>Record Desktop Silently</title><link>https://trimad.github.io/post/2022-02-09-record-desktop-silently/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trimad.github.io/post/2022-02-09-record-desktop-silently/</guid><description>
Place these 3 files in any directory and run update.vbs to begin recording a Windows session silently.
Github Repository
update.exe This file is just ffmpeg that's been renamed to be slightly more inconspicuous in Task Manager. update.bat There are two lines to this batch file. The first line deletes &amp;quot;output.mp4&amp;quot; if it already exists in the same directory. The framerate in frames per second of the recording is set here following the &amp;quot;-framerate&amp;quot; flag The amount of time in seconds to record is set here following the &amp;quot;-t&amp;quot; flag output.</description></item></channel></rss>

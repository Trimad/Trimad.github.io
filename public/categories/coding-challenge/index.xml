            This is a maximum flow problem on a bipartite graph. I created the flow chart above to visualize the 3 test cases. The virtual judge run time was 0.18s.

            &#34;Now that you’re back to school for another term, you need to remember how to work the combination lock on your locker. A common design is that of the Master Brand, shown at right. The lock has a dial with 40 calibration marks numbered 0 to 39. A combination consists of 3 of these numbers; for example: 15-25-8. To open the lock, the following steps are taken...&#34;

            &#34;Problems in Computer Science are often classified as belonging to a certain class of problems (e.g., NP, Unsolvable, Recursive). In this problem you will be analyzing a property of an algorithm whose classification is not known for all possible inputs. Consider the following algorithm...&#34;

            &#34;There is man named ”mabu” for switching on-off light in our University. He switches on-off the lights in a corridor. Every bulb has its own toggle switch. That is, if it is pressed then the bulb turns on. Another press will turn it off. To save power consumption (or may be he is mad or something else) he does a peculiar thing. If in a corridor there is n bulbs, he walks along the corridor back and forth n times and in i-th walk he toggles only the switches whose serial is divisable by i. He does not press any switch when coming back to his initial position. A i-th walk is defined as going down the corridor (while doing the peculiar thing) and coming back again. Now you have to determine what is the final condition of the last bulb. Is it on or off?&#34;

            &#34;When shopping on Long Street, Michael usually parks his car at some random location, and then walks to the stores he needs. Can you help Michael choose a place to park which minimises the distance he needs to walk on his shopping round? Long Street is a straight line, where all positions are integer. You pay for parking in a specific slot, which is an integer position on Long Street. Michael does not want to pay for more than one parking though. He is very strong, and does not mind carrying all the bags around.&#34;

            &#34;Every day, your job requires you to add up long lists of integers, like the following:

3 + 2 + -4 + 8 + 3 + -6 + 1 + 4 + 6 + -1 + -6 = 10

That is, a sum of positive and negative integers, followed by an equals sign, followed by a single integer. To save yourself some time, you normally leave out the and signs as you write down your work, so the previous example would be...&#34;

            &#34;Some operators checks about the relationship between two values and these operators are called relational operators. Given two numerical values your job is just to find out the relationship between them that is (i) First one is greater than the second (ii) First one is less than the second or (iii) First and second one is equal.&#34;

            &#34;An eccentric coach asks players on the team to line up alphabetically at the start of practice. The coach does not tell the players whether they need to line up in increasing or decreasing order, so they guess. If they guess wrong, the coach makes them run laps before practice. Given a list of names, you are to determine if the list is in increasing alphabetical order, decreasing alphabetical order or neither.&#34;

Each day, you can dedicate the server to run these tasks for at most minutes. Given the time each task takes, you want to know how many of them will be finished today.&#34;

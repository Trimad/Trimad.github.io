            The logistic map is a mathematical model used to describe the population growth of a species over time. It is a simple equation that takes into account the effects of limited resources and environmental factors on population growth. The logistic map produces a pattern of population growth that exhibits chaotic behavior as the values of the model&#39;s parameters change, making it a valuable tool for studying complex systems.

            _k-means clustering_ is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells.

            The Buddhabrot fractal is a type of fractal that is generated by plotting the paths of points that escape from the Mandelbrot set. The resulting image resembles a series of intertwined spirals and branches, and is named after the shape it resembles, which is said to resemble the seated figure of Buddha. The Buddhabrot fractal is created by assigning each point in the complex plane a &#34;color&#34; based on how many times it takes for that point to escape from the Mandelbrot set, and then plotting the paths of the points that do escape. This process is repeated millions of times, resulting in a highly detailed and intricate fractal image.

            This Processing sketch loads two images and creates an image mask that blends them together. The transparency of the image mask is determined by 4D Open Simplex Noise, which loops perfectly.

            In this sketch I turned every pixel of an image into a Lorenz System. I mapped the velocity of that system to the brightness value of the pixel. This was the result. Sadly, the Processing sketch I made this with is gone forever.

      <description>
        
          
            The Barnsley Fern is a fractal pattern named after British mathematician Michael Barnsley. It is generated by an iterative process that involves repeatedly applying a set of geometric transformations to a simple initial shape. The resulting fern-like pattern displays self-similarity at different scales, and has applications in computer graphics, image compression, and chaos theory.

            TurboReader is my solution to the poor input performance of Scanner. All I need from a Reader in most programming contest problems is the ability to read ints and Double, and to read them quickly. That is all this class does, and it also tokenizes those values so that I never have to address empty lines in the text input. I have two versions of this class; a buffered version and an unbuffered version.

      <title>Kruskal&#39;s Algorithm Visualized With Processing</title>

      <description>
        
          
            Kruskal&#39;s algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the minimum spanning tree of a connected, weighted graph. The algorithm works by sorting the edges of the graph by weight, and then adding the edges to the minimum spanning tree one by one, making sure to avoid creating cycles. Kruskal&#39;s algorithm has a time complexity of O(E log E) where E is the number of edges in the graph, and is widely used in network design and optimization problems.

            &#34;There is man named ”mabu” for switching on-off light in our University. He switches on-off the lights in a corridor. Every bulb has its own toggle switch. That is, if it is pressed then the bulb turns on. Another press will turn it off. To save power consumption (or may be he is mad or something else) he does a peculiar thing. If in a corridor there is n bulbs, he walks along the corridor back and forth n times and in i-th walk he toggles only the switches whose serial is divisable by i. He does not press any switch when coming back to his initial position. A i-th walk is defined as going down the corridor (while doing the peculiar thing) and coming back again. Now you have to determine what is the final condition of the last bulb. Is it on or off?&#34;

            &#34;When shopping on Long Street, Michael usually parks his car at some random location, and then walks to the stores he needs. Can you help Michael choose a place to park which minimises the distance he needs to walk on his shopping round? Long Street is a straight line, where all positions are integer. You pay for parking in a specific slot, which is an integer position on Long Street. Michael does not want to pay for more than one parking though. He is very strong, and does not mind carrying all the bags around.&#34;

            &#34;Every day, your job requires you to add up long lists of integers, like the following:

3 + 2 + -4 + 8 + 3 + -6 + 1 + 4 + 6 + -1 + -6 = 10

That is, a sum of positive and negative integers, followed by an equals sign, followed by a single integer. To save yourself some time, you normally leave out the and signs as you write down your work, so the previous example would be...&#34;

            &#34;Some operators checks about the relationship between two values and these operators are called relational operators. Given two numerical values your job is just to find out the relationship between them that is (i) First one is greater than the second (ii) First one is less than the second or (iii) First and second one is equal.&#34;

            &#34;An eccentric coach asks players on the team to line up alphabetically at the start of practice. The coach does not tell the players whether they need to line up in increasing or decreasing order, so they guess. If they guess wrong, the coach makes them run laps before practice. Given a list of names, you are to determine if the list is in increasing alphabetical order, decreasing alphabetical order or neither.&#34;

            &#34;You are in charge of a server that needs to run some submitted tasks on a first-come, first-served basis. Each day, you can dedicate the server to run these tasks for at most minutes. Given the time each task takes, you want to know how many of them will be finished today.&#34;

            Counting sort is a non-comparison based sorting algorithm that works by determining, for each element in an input array, the number of elements that are less than it. This information is then used to place the element in its correct position in the output array. The algorithm has a linear time complexity of O(n+k), where n is the number of elements in the input array and k is the range of values in the input array.
